# Luggage-Packer

‣ **OBJECTIVE**

To help users pack their bags efficiently so that ach item of utmost importance is included in their luggage .


‣ **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Given a knapsack with a limited weight capacity and few items having some weight and value,
We have to select the items that can be placed into the knapsack such that
(i) The profit obtained by placing those items in the knapsack is maximum
(ii) The weight limit of knapsack does not exceed

‣ **ABSTRACT**

The knapsack problem is an important combinatorial optimization problem that models binary and discrete decisions given limited resources. This project addresses theoretical, and algorithmic issues regarding two of the knapsack problem variations, with application to packaging luggage. This project presents dynamic programming algorithms that produce optimal solutions in pseudo-polynomial time, greedy heuristics, and fully polynomial time approximation schemes.
